# Bright Data Scraper Studio — Claude Code skill

A skill that teaches Claude Code, Cursor or Codex how to build, run and self-heal custom web
scrapers for any public site, entirely from the terminal.

Point your coding agent at a URL, describe the data you want in plain English, and get back a
working scraper you own — plus a Collector ID that is already a live API endpoint.

## Install

**Claude Code**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IncomeStreamSurfer/brightdata-scraper-studio-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/brightdata-scraper-studio
```

**opencode**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IncomeStreamSurfer/brightdata-scraper-studio-skill.git ~/.config/opencode/skills/brightdata-scraper-studio
```

Either way it's picked up on the next session — no config, no restart. Same `SKILL.md`, same
frontmatter, both agents read it as-is.

**Already have it in Claude Code?** Symlink instead of cloning twice, so there's one source of
truth to edit:

```bash
ln -s ~/.claude/skills/brightdata-scraper-studio ~/.config/opencode/skills/brightdata-scraper-studio
```

**Cursor / Codex:** clone anywhere and point your rules file at `SKILL.md`, or copy its
contents into `.cursor/rules` or `AGENTS.md`.

**Verify it loaded:** ask your agent *"what do you know about Bright Data Scraper Studio?"* —
it should reference the five scraper types without searching the web.

## What it covers

- **Setup in three commands** — runs via `npx`, so no global install, no `sudo`, no `EACCES`,
  no node version manager fights
- **Picking the right scraper type** — PDP, Discovery, Discovery + PDP, Search, and Sitemap,
  with the rule for naming the shape explicitly so you don't pay the build time twice
- **The build loop** — `create` → `run` → `heal` → `approve`
- **Self-healing** — when a site changes its HTML, one prompt repairs the scraper you own and
  keeps the same Collector ID, so every downstream trigger and schedule keeps working
- **Pinning the Collector ID** in your rules file so agents stop rebuilding the scraper on
  every session and just run it
- **The trigger API** — batch and real-time paths, callable from any language or scheduler
- **A "check for a faster path first" step** — `scrape`, `search`, `discover` and 43 pre-built
  `pipelines` all return in seconds, so the agent doesn't burn 15 minutes rebuilding something
  that already exists

## Why the gotchas section matters

Every gotcha in the skill is a failure hit in real use, not a guess:

- zsh globs on unquoted URLs — `...?v=abc` dies with `no matches found` before the CLI runs
- piping a long-running command into `head` SIGPIPEs the poller and destroys the result
- stale docs examples return `{"error": "dead_page"}` rather than failing loudly
- `scraper create` takes 5–25 minutes, so an agent must never start one without telling you

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- A Bright Data account — [brdta.com/iss25](https://brdta.com/iss25) for $25 of credit

No global install needed. The skill runs everything through `npx -p @brightdata/cli`.
